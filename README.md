# Map
### Code Description:

1. **HTML Structure:**
   - The HTML structure defines a basic webpage with a map container (`<div id="map">`) and a button to trigger the animation.

2. **CSS Styles:**
   - The CSS styles define the layout and positioning of the map and overlay elements.

3. **JavaScript Logic:**
   - Initializes the Mapbox map instance and adds a marker at the initial bus stop.
   - The `move()` function is responsible for animating the marker's movement between bus stops.

### How to Run the Code:
To run this code, follow these steps:

1. Save the provided HTML code into a file, for example, `map_animation.html`.
2. Open the file in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

When you click the "Show stops between MIT and Harvard" button, the marker will move sequentially between the bus stops.

### Future Enhancements:
Here are some suggestions for enhancing this map animation:

1. **Customized Marker Icon:**
   - Use a custom marker icon to make the map visualization more appealing.

2. **Path Animation:**
   - Display a line or path connecting the bus stops to visualize the route.

3. **Speed Control:**
   - Allow the user to control the speed of the animation.
